# TauBot_v1,6

Taumich's personal assistant. This is the source code for the fundamental part to get the Taumich's bot to function. Development has been moved to a private git for continued development and research of the bot and its behaviour due to security protocols. The AI-features have also been hidden as to prevent the public from access to it.

What you can use this bare-bone state of the bot to: Launch the game Guild-Wars 2 in a very mechanical, yet human-like behaviour, enter social media and to show activity.

If you'd like to find out more regarding the bots's state or have any enquiries then please contact me at taumichempire@gmail.com
